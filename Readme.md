# Attendance Management System

## Description
The project is designed to eliminate the
need for manual attendance-taking, which can be time-consuming
and prone to errors. With the proposed system, students or
employees can simply present their faces to a camera, and the

system also includes a user-friendly interface for teachers or
managers to view and manage attendance records. Overall, the
attendance system using the face recognition project offers a reliable
and efficient solution for attendance-taking in various settings
